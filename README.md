# Patterns

## Introduction

When developing an application or system, **design patterns** are the best, established approaches a programmer may apply to handle common challenges.

**Design patterns** can help developers save time by providing tried-and-true development paradigms.

**Design patterns** are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen.

### üò∂‚¨Ü Heads up

- **Design patterns aren't a panacea** 
- Do not try to compel them; if you do, awful things are bound to happen.
- They can be a lifesaver if used in the right place and in the right way, or they can be a disaster if used incorrectly.

## Objectives

- **You** want to improve **how** you develop
- **You** wish you could **have clear criteria for determining how to improve a software design proposal.**
- **You**  ![Don't need to reinvent the wheel](static/img/wheel.jpg)

## Getting started 

### Design patterns **advantages** 
  - They are reusable and can be used in multiple projects.
  - They provide template solutions.
  - They provide transparency to software design.
  - They are well-tested and proven means of developing robust solutions effortlessly.
