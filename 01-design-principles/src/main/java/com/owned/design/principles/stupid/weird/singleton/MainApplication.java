         *
         * From effective Java:
         * Making a class a singleton can make it difficult to test its clients, as itâ€™s impossible to substitute a mock implementation for a singleton unless it implements an interface that serves as its type.
         *
         * ... let's do it ...
         *
         * @see JdbcConnectionV2 .... now we can use Connection fakes !!
         *
         * ... wait ...
         *
         * How about testing JdbcConnectionV2.java?
         * Your turn ...
         *
         * Wait ... we will refactor as Effective Java says ...
